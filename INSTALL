Installation Instructions
*************************

  Note that X must work. On a mac, this means install Xquartz.

  To build the latest and possibly greatest, check out from github.

  I myself have it run on
  * solaris (8)
  * debian (lenny, squeeze and wheezy)
  * ubuntu (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15)
  * centos (6 and 7)
  * mac osx (10.7, 10.8, 10.9, 10.10 and 10.11).

  Just saying

make

  should work, if there is a sane GTK environment. If this;

pkg-config --cflags libglade-2.0

  works, i.e. returns a bunch of c-flags, you should be OK.

  On a deb-based system, installing libglade2-dev should be enough. On
  yum-based systems it's called libglade2-devel.

  On osx, you should use homebrew. this is probably enough;

brew install libglade coreutils
